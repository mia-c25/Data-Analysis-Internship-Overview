# Data Analysis Internship Overview
For this project I used the data I obtained from my internship with Sally Owens for Illinois State Senate to create a map to show how many voter there were per zip code in the 46th District. I was only able to get the data from the Peoria County Election Commission, so therefore it isn't the complete set of voter data in the district.
Since this data is straight from the Peoria County Election Commission, it is a reputable source. Each day I would be sent a small file with the voter data from the day before and would give a report, via a pivot table in a Microsoft Execl Sheet to Sally Owens and her team to get an understanding of where they should do more outreach.
